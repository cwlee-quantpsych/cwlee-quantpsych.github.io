# Welcome!

I am Chaewon Lee, a quantitative psychologist and data scientist.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Psychology program, housed within the L.L.Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chaple Hill.
My research aims at developing and disseminating advanced statistical methods to address unique methodological challenges in psychological science. Specifically, I work on:

- Machine learning and deep learning  
- Time-series analysis
- Dynamic network modeling
- Structural equation modeling
- Fuzzy modeling

My work is guided by three grand pillars: 
1. Introducing and adapting machine learning and deep learning techniques to address the unique challenges of psychological data and meet the growing needs of big data methods for digital sensor research;
2. Modeling intraindividual dynamics in psychological processes with greater robustness and precision;
3. Leveraging statistical frameworks based on fuzzy theory to more effectively incorporate the inherent imprecision and uncertainty in psychological measurement.

Substantively, I am also invested in applying these methodological innovations to real-world psychological research spanning diverse domains such as clinical, cognitive, social, health, and educational psychology, where I use advanced statistical and computational tools to tackle complex, context-specific questions. 
In particular, my ongoing interest lies in advancing precision psychopathology by developing individualized, data-informed approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and real-time intervention of mental health conditiions including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
