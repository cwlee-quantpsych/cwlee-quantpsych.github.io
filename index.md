# Welcome!

I am Chaewon Lee, a quantitative psychologist and data scientist.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Psychology program, housed within the L.L.Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chaple Hill.
My research aims at developing and disseminating advanced statistical methods to address unique methodological challenges in psychological science. Specifically, I work on:

- Machine learning and deep learning  
- Time-series analysis
- Dynamic network modeling
- Structural equation modeling
- Fuzzy modeling

My work is guided by three grand pillars: 
1. Introducing and adapting machine learning and deep learning techniques to address the unique challenges of psychological data and meet the growing needs of big data methods for digital sensor research;
2. Modeling intraindividual dynamics in psychological processes with greater robustness and precision;
3. Leveraging statistical frameworks based on fuzzy theory to more effectively incorporate the inherent imprecision and uncertainty in psychological measurement.

Substantively, I am also invested in applying these methodological innovations to real-world psychological research. My work spans a range of domains—including clinical, cognitive, social, health, and educational psychology—where I use advanced statistical and computational tools to investigate complex, context-specific questions. 
In particular, my ongoing interest lies in predictive modeling to advance precision psychopathology by developing individualized, data-informed approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and real-time intervention of mental health conditiions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

A complete list of my publications is provided below.

### Beyond Research

I am also a classically trained pianist who began playing at the age of three. I attended specialized arts middle and high schools in Korea to study piano professionally. While I’m not pursuing music as a career, I continue to enjoy playing in my spare time.

During my teenage years, I won several major national music competitions in Korea, performed on numerous stages, and collaborated with the Seoul Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Grieg’s Piano Concerto in a minor. At the age of 14, I was prestigiously selected as a musical prodigy by Kumho Asiana Group, one of Korea’s leading conglomerates—a recognition that led to my own solo recital. My favorite repertoire includes Bach–Busoni’s *Chaconne*, Mendelssohn’s *Variations sérieuses*, Chopin’s Ballades, and more. In addition to solo performance, I have also performed as an accompanist for violinists, cellists, and vocalists across various concert and competition settings.
