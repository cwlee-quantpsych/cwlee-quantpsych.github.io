      I am Chaewon Lee, a quantitative psychologist, data scientist, and statistician.  
      I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Psychology program, housed within the L.L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

      <br><br>

      My research focuses on developing and disseminating advanced statistical methods to address unique methodological challenges in psychological science. Specifically, I work on:

      <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Machine learning and deep learning</li>
        <li>Time-series analysis</li>
        <li>Dynamic network modeling</li>
        <li>Structural equation modeling</li>
        <li>Fuzzy statistical modeling</li>
      </ul>

My work is guided by three grand pillars:

1. Introducing and adapting machine learning and deep learning techniques to address the unique challenges of psychological data and meet the growing needs of big data methods for digital sensor research;
2. Modeling intraindividual dynamics in psychological processes with greater robustness and precision;
3. Leveraging statistical frameworks based on fuzzy theory to more effectively incorporate the inherent imprecision and uncertainty in psychological measurement.

Substantively, I am deeply invested in applying these methodological innovations to real-world psychological research. My work spans a range of domains—including clinical, cognitive, social, health, and educational psychology—where I use advanced statistical and computational tools to investigate complex, context-specific questions. 
In particular, my ongoing interest lies in predictive modeling to advance precision psychopathology by developing individualized, data-informed approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and real-time intervention of mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

A complete list of my publications is provided below.

## Research Collaborations

I have collaborated on multiple interdisciplinary research projects, including:

- The NSF IUSE Student Success Project (PIs: Gates, K., & Greene, J.) at the UNC School of Education and the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, where I applied machine learning and Markov modeling to learning management system (LMS) data to forecast student performance in undergraduate biology courses.

- The EPICS Mood and Schizophrenia Lab (PI: Deldin, P.J.) at the University of Michigan, where I analyzed event-related potentials (ERP) to classify psychiatric patients and predict suicidality of individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder using techniques such as deep learning and feature selection.

- Collaborations with Dr. Tom Rodebaugh’s clinical research team at UNC Chapel Hill on dynamic time series modeling of tinnitus symptoms, using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME).

- Ongoing collaborations with mathematicians and engineers in South Korea, exploring the application of fuzzy set theory and chaos theory to model complex dynamics in social opinion formation.

## Education

Before embarking on my Ph.D. training, I earned an M.S. in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan, an M.A. in Economics from Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, and a B.S. in Biology also from Yonsei University.

## Teaching & Instruction

At UNC Chapel Hill, I have served as a teaching assistant for PSYC 210 (Statistical Principles of Psychological Research) across multiple semesters since 2020. In this role, I led recitation sessions, assisted students with SPSS- and Jamovi-based data analysis, and provided individualized support. I was recognized with the Departmental Undergraduate Teaching Commendation twice, based on student evaluations.

## Fun Facts About Me

**Fact 1. I am a classically trained pianist.**  
I began playing the piano at the age of three and attended specialized arts middle and high schools in Korea to study it professionally. During my teenage years, I won several major national music competitions, performed on numerous stages, and collaborated with the Seoul Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A minor. At the age of 14, I was prestigiously selected as a musical prodigy by the Kumho Asiana Group—one of Korea’s leading conglomerates—which led to my own solo recital. My favorite repertoire includes Bach–Busoni’s *Chaconne*, Mendelssohn’s *Variations sérieuses*, Chopin’s Ballades, and more. In addition to solo performance, I have also performed as an accompanist for violinists, cellists, and vocalists in various concert and competition settings.

**Fact 2. I used to work as an economist and investment banker.**  
Before entering academia, I worked at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul. I first served as a junior investment banker in the Equity Capital Market Department, where I worked on IPOs for KOSPI and KOSDAQ, conducting due diligence, accounting analysis, and preparing listing applications. I later transitioned to the Research Center as a junior economist, where I authored analytical reports on global macroeconomic trends and financial markets, and led forecasting for indicators such as exchange rates, crude oil prices, and international policy rates.
